Instuction for installing Webpack for Ubuntu 16/.04

## FIRST MAKE SURE TO HAVE PROPER NODE.JS VERSION INSTALLED TO AVOID npm crashes
Node.js LTS (v10.x):

# Using Ubuntu
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs


 install webpack
 $  npm install --save-dev webpack@4.25.1


 If you're using webpack v4 or later, you'll also need to install the CLI.

npm install --save-dev webpack-cli

create a 2 folder
   1 - <src>for source of Bundle
   2 - <dist> for origin where I want to inject
   3 - add .js files to src folder
   4 - build Bundle
      $ ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development
